			Once upon a time, there was a giraffe named Ginger.
			Ginger lived in Kenya, a country in Africa. Like all giraffes, Ginger had a long neck and long legs. Because shw was so tall, she was able to eat food from very tops of tress in the savannah. The savannah in Africa is an area with lots of grass and some trees.
			Sometimes, a savannah is called grasslands. The other animals like zebras and antelopes could not reach where Ginger could reach. But Ginger always found food. She loved the leaves and the new buds of the trees.
